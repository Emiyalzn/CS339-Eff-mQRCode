## Abstract
Quick Response (QR) codes have become universal in our life due to their rapid readability and the popularity of smartphones with built-in cameras. However, researchers have found that QR codes are vulnerable to various kinds of attacks (e.g. replay attack), which may lead to huge financial loss and private information leakage. To resist such attacks as well as maintaining QR codes' convenience, we follow [mQRCode](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3300061.3345428)'s work and propose `Eff-mQRCode`, which exploits Moir√© pattern to hide QR codes from an inappropriate position. In addition, we propose a GAN-based decryption method and do comprehensive experiments to prove its validity. The experiments illustrate that our decryption method is more robust to different environments and can achieve much shorter decryption time than the original multi-frame decryption method.

## Pipeline
Generally, our system pipeline is shown in the figure below. First, we encode data in the form of QR codes. Then we encrypt the QR codes through phase modulation, frequency modulation and adding noise. For decryption, we capture photographs at a right position and decode them using multi-frame algorithm or feeding them into our pretrained GAN. Ultimately, we can get the data from the decrypted QR codes.
